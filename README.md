# Titanic

In the Titanic dataset exercise, logistic regression and KNN are used to predict passenger survival based on different variables.

Logistic Regression:
Data Preparation: Clean and split the data.
Modeling: Train a logistic regression model to predict survival probabilities.
Evaluation: Assess accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC on test data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Data Preparation: Similar to logistic regression.
Modeling: Train a KNN model to classify survival based on neighbors' characteristics.
Evaluation: Measure the same metrics as logistic regression for performance comparison.
Logistic regression is more interpretable, while KNN can capture complex relationships.
